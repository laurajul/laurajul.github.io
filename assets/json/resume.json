{"basics":{"name":"Laura Wagner","label":"Doctoral Candidate","image":"","summary":"Since early 2024, Laura has been pursuing her PhD at the University of Zurich. Her research begins with investigating open-source text-to-image and video generative AI models in the wild, with a focus on how they are adopted, personalized and reshared across communities. She is particularly interested in how systemic issues—such as the appropriation of unlicensed or violent material in training data—reappear in personalized model outputs and community practices. Her work is part of the project “The Canon of Latent Spaces: How Large AI Models Encode Art and Culture,” which explores how generative AI encodes art and culture.","location":{"city":"Zürich","countryCode":"CH","region":"Switzerland"},"profiles":[{"network":"Linktree","url":"linktree"}]},"work":[{"name":"Universität Zürich","location":"Zürich, Switzerland","position":"Doctoral Candidate Kunstgeschichte der Neuzeit","url":"","startDate":"2024-02","endDate":"NOW","summary":"Research on open-source text-to-image AI personalizations and their societal impact","highlights":["Investigating toxicity in open-source text-to-image communities","Exploring pathways for equitable and responsible model personalization"]},{"name":"KISD -
