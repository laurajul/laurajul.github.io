Devices with interactive multi touch surfaces are ubiquitous and are getting more and more sophisticated in terms of providing experiences, that thanks to ultra low latencies and carefully tuned prediction algorithms are smooth and have a natural feel to them. But the digital world lacks physicality and neglects the human sense of touch and does not make use of the fine motor skills of the human hands that allow for high precision tasks and complex manipulation. Also the human capability of bi-manualism and spacial multiplexing is often not exploited.

Tangible user interfaces are an interface type that interlinks the the digital and physical worlds, and allows for exploration of digital content through manipulation of physical objects.Tangibles are not mere input devicesbut they can superimpose elements of the graphical user interface or become fully fused with it. In other words: they are - part of the interface brought to life. The goal of this project was to explore tangible objects as control elements, categorise them by comparing them to input devices and peripherals, analyse them in terms of affordances, and define scenarios, where they could be of use. All this while referring to scientific studies evaluating the performance of tangible user interfaces. This work resulted in a prototype that aims to explore, how tangible control elements could help to navigate through a complex data set, while enhancing the users experience.

<h2>Trade Fair Demonstrators for Fraunhofer</h2>
During my Bachelor's studies, I had the opportunity to work at [Fraunhofer IPT](https://www.ipt.fraunhofer.de/) in Aachen. Together with Hoc-Tin Trieu and the team at Fraunhofer, I developed several interactive trade fair demonstrators designed to communicate different use cases in industrial production chains. Since these chains typically involve a single workpiece undergoing multiple stages of manufacturing, I integrated this concept with the 3D-printed capacitive markers I had developed for my Bachelor's thesis.

A key part of this work involved close collaboration with engineers from various departments. I spent a lot of time discussing their workflows and trying to understand what aspects of their processes they wanted to convey to visitors. These conversations directly informed the design of the demonstrators. The tangible interfaces we created turned out to be an ideal medium for industrial exhibitions, as they allowed us to represent both the digital and physical aspects of production in an engaging and accessible way.
